Today, Rena introduced us to Number Theory, the theory of numbers! Specifically, she introduced us prime factorization, LCF, CGM, and the euclidian algorithm. These rules are critical for speedy progress in math contests, and the euclidian algorithm really helps for non-calculator contests!

Remember to study for the COMC math contest, which will take place on Tuesday, November the 2nd
