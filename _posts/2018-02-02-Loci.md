Congratulations on finishing exams, and welcome to Semester Two!

This week, Rena introduced us to a new topic, Loci (plural of locus). a Locus is a set of points that satisfy a particular position, for example the set of all points that lie on a circle or the set of all points that lie on a line. This is incredibly important especially for higher level geometry with complex shapes in the cartesian plane.
