This week, former Lisgar students Hao Wang and Andrej Vukovic visited Lisgar and shared their experiences with the BMath program at Carleton. Richard Hoshino from Quest Univeristy BC visited as well. He is a former Canadian team member for the International Math Olympiad and has had extensive experience running math competition training.

At the meeting, we addressed strategies for practicing for contests and what makes a good contest writier. In addition, we performed a few problem solving exercises to help demonstrate what academic theoretical math is like for students and researchers.
