Today, Charles introduced the Pigeon Hole Principle, which states that if you have n+1 pigeons but only n holes, there must be at least two pigeons in one hole. While this seems like a simple problem, when coupled with other principles it can be quite challanging! 

There are three general steps for any pigeon hole problem:
  1. **Identify that it's a pigeon hole problem**
  * A big tip is when you have two numbers which are almost divisible, but one is slightly larger than a multiple of the other (eg. 20 boxes and 51 pieces). However, pigeon hole problems are not always that easy to see. 
   2. **Identify what the pigons are and what the holes are**
   * This is a critical step to avoid making mistakes, and to make the process easy. What do you have? what are you trying to find?
   3. **Solve the rest of the problem**
   * Often, pigeon hole problems have an additional step beyond just the principle. This can be geometry, combinatorics, number theory, or even proofs!
